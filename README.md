Overview:

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict diseases based on features extracted from laboratory blood samples. Users can input blood sample features, and the model predicts whether they have certain diseases. The project is implemented in a web interface where users can upload their blood sample features, and the prediction is made in real-time.

Features:

Logistic Regression Model: A machine learning model trained to predict diseases from blood sample features.
User-Friendly Web Interface: Allows users to upload their blood sample features for disease prediction.
Real-Time Disease Prediction: Provides instant predictions based on input blood sample features.
Technology Stack:
Backend: Python, Logistic Regression
Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React
Database: SQL
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Tools & Libraries Used
SQL: Used for storing and retrieving data.
HTML/CSS: Frontend for user input and results display.
JavaScript (React): To build the dynamic web interface.
Python: Backend logic and implementation of the Logistic Regression model.
Scikit-learn: Used for building the machine learning model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Flask/Django (if applicable): For connecting the frontend and backend.

Dataset: 
This model was trained on a dataset containing laboratory blood test features, such as:

Hemoglobin levels
White blood cell counts
Red blood cell counts
Platelet counts
Glucose levels
Cholesterol levels
And other biochemical markers
You can customize or replace the dataset to fit different disease prediction needs.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-prediction.git
cd disease-prediction
Install required Python packages: Install the necessary libraries to run the backend:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Web Application: If you're using Flask (for example):

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the application.

Usage
Upload Blood Sample Features:

Use the web interface to upload a file containing blood sample features or manually enter the values.
Get Disease Prediction:

The Logistic Regression model will process the input and provide a prediction on whether the user has a specific disease.
Modify the Dataset:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
If you want to train the model with a different dataset, simply replace the existing dataset with one containing similar blood test features and retrain the model.
How It Works:
Model Training: The logistic regression model was trained on a labeled dataset containing blood sample features and corresponding disease labels.
Web Interface: The frontend allows users to upload their blood sample features, which are then sent to the backend for processing.
Real-Time Prediction: Once the data is processed by the Logistic Regression model, it provides a prediction about the likelihood of disease.
Future Improvements
Integrating other machine learning models like XGBoost for better performance.
Expanding the dataset to cover a broader range of diseases.
Adding more advanced visualizations of the results in the web interface.
